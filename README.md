usage: wk.sh <INTERFACE> <APMAC> <CHANNEL> <b/w> [LISTFILE] [c]

b/w specifies blacklist (targeted) or whitelist mode.

LISTFILE should contain the MACs to avoid deauthing (whitelist) or to target (blacklist).

the c (continuous) flag lets the script run continuously forever.

the rest is self explanatory, requires the aircrack suite.

hope you don't actually use this, this script is not safe, it was only made to kick public wifi squatters and take their place, maybe it will be usable sometime soon.
